### V. THE PRACTICE OF PROGRAMMING - ⚠️ NEEDS REMAPPING
**1/25 files updated (4%)**

Only "runtime-error.md" was found and updated.
The actual file structure uses different naming conventions:
- `/programming/creation/` - 7 files
- `/programming/debugging/` - 10 files  
- `/programming/deployment/` - 6 files
- `/programming/testing/` - 6 files

**ACTION NEEDED:** Remap files to match actual structure

---

### VI. MOMENTS OF STRUGGLE & DOUBT - ❌ NEEDS REMAPPING
**0/24 files updated**

Actual structure found:
- `/struggle/ethical/` - 7 files
- `/struggle/failure/` - 10 files
- `/struggle/personal/` - 10 files

**ACTION NEEDED:** Remap files to match actual structure

---

### VII. ETHICAL & VOCATIONAL FORMATION - ❌ NEEDS REMAPPING
**0/21 files updated**

Actual structure found:
- `/formation/character/` - 7 files
- `/formation/vocation/` - 8 files

**ACTION NEEDED:** Remap files to match actual structure

---

### IX-XIII: REMAINING SECTIONS - ❌ NEED REMAPPING

All remaining sections (Tools, Rhythms, Relationships, Mind, Occasions) need file name mapping as the actual file names differ from the expected prayer titles.

---

## Summary Statistics

### ✅ Successfully Updated: **92 files**
- Section II (Learning): 30 files
- Section III (Teaching): 38 files
- Section IV (Collaboration): 17 files
- Section VIII (Domains): 6 files
- Section V (Programming): 1 file

### ⚠️ Remaining Work
Sections V, VI, VII, IX, X, XI, XII, and XIII require careful file name mapping as the actual file names in the repository don't match the expected prayer titles from the structure document.

---

## Next Steps

To complete the remaining updates, we need to:
1. Map actual file names to their corresponding prayer titles for sections V-XIII
2. Create updated bash scripts with correct file mappings
3. Run the update scripts for the remaining sections
