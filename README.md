# Prayers for Computer Science

A collection of prayers for those who study, teach, and practice the craft of computing.

## About

This website offers prayers for every season, struggle, and celebration in the life of computer science students and professors. From the first day of class to defending a thesis, from debugging frustrating code to experiencing breakthrough moments, these prayers invite us to bring our whole selves before God.

## Structure

The prayers are organized into 13 major categories:

1. **The Rhythms of the Academic Year** - Beginnings, middles, endings, and transitions
2. **The Work of Learning** - For students: intellectual struggle, breakthroughs, daily work, assessment
3. **The Work of Teaching** - For professors: preparation, classroom, mentorship, research
4. **Collaboration & Community** - Working together, academic community, mentorship
5. **The Practice of Programming** - Creation, debugging, testing, deployment
6. **Moments of Struggle & Doubt** - Personal challenges, failure, ethical struggles
7. **Ethical & Vocational Formation** - Wisdom, calling, character
8. **Specific CS Domains** - Core areas, specialized fields, mathematical foundations
9. **Technology & Tools** - Git, IDEs, infrastructure
10. **Seasons & Daily Rhythms** - Daily, weekly, and seasonal patterns
11. **Relationships & Humanity** - With students, professors, peers, family
12. **The Life of the Mind** - Wonder, limits, integration
13. **Special Occasions** - Celebrations, commemorations, lament
