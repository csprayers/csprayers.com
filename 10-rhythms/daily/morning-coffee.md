*Starting the day*

---

> Good morning, King of the Universe

> As my body starts to realize it is a new day, I turn to you
> 
> As I sip from my cup and think about the day ahead, you remind me that you are always present

> I praise you for a night of rest and restoration
> 
> And for the tasks that await  me at my computer

> I thank you for the great duty of finding order in the code I create
> 
> As you created me in your image, I am also able to create
> 
> As Adam and Eve rebelled against you, I am also able to destroy
> 
> Create for good, create for evil
> 
> Destroy for good, destroy for evil

> In this morning’s glimpse of a new day, I turn to you
> 
> As I smell my coffee, and think about the challenges ahead of me, you remind me to be holy as you are
> 
> You invite me to use my hands to bring into existence programs that glorify you
> 
> To gift the world with code that proclaims your glory

> May my code be creative, effective, hospitable
> 
> May my code prevent others of making mistakes, and keep me from dragging myself into sloppy solutions
> 
> May my code be a reflection of the love I have for you and for my neighbor

> If I need to delete parts of my code, may I be wise enough to avoid wasting time coding things that won’t work, as a good steward should
> 
> If I forget specifics and leave some functions behind, may I remember that you never forget us
>
> Enlighten me when I get stuck, not knowing what to do next
> 
> And join me in joy when my code runs smoothly

> May my code be a reflection of who you want me to be
> 
> And as I finish my morning coffee and turn to the important work I need to do
> 
> Let not me be distracted by other things
> 
> Make my heart rest, knowing you will take care of my beloved ones and my coworkers
> 
> So I don’t need to constantly check my messages and emails
> 
> Make my mind focused and disposed to find satisfaction in the coding and nothing more
> 
> So I don’t get myself lost in the infinite timelines of social media and sensationalist news

> Help me today, Lord
> 
> I will open my computer, and I will worship you with all I am
> 
> A creature whose core is programmed to love you through my programs
> 
> Amen.
